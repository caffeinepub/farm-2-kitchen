  "architectural_notes": [
    "Contact CTA should open WhatsApp chat to +91 9818856274 (wa.me link), not a phone-call link.",
    "Remove/disable contact form UI and do not store visitor messages in backend since messaging is removed.",
    "Ensure above-the-fold/hero (starting section) text has sufficient contrast vs background; adjust text color and font styling for readability.",
    "User preference change: keep the Hero/top text black (do not switch the “Experience the…”/top lighter text to white). Ensure readability via other contrast methods if needed (e.g., overlay/gradient, background adjustment).",
