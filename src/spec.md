# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Hero section’s gradient overlay stronger so the hero heading and description remain clearly readable on desktop and mobile.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the overlay gradient opacity values in `frontend/src/features/marketing/sections/HeroSection.tsx` to a noticeably stronger (higher opacity) overlay while keeping the same left-to-right warm gradient direction.
- Verify hero heading and full description text readability across common viewport sizes without changing any user-facing copy.

**User-visible outcome:** The hero text (“Pure Haldi. From Farm to Your Kitchen.” and its description) is easier to read against the hero background image on both mobile and desktop.
